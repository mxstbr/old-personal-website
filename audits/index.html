    <h1>Remote Codebase Audits by a React expert</h1>
    <p>I'm available for hire for remote codebase audits of React applications. I do a deep dive into your production codebase and compile a report full of recommendations designed to <strong>speed up day-to-day development for years to come by empowering your team to move faster than ever before!</strong></p>

    <h2>Why you should hire me</h2>
    <p><strong>I'm an expert and community leader in the React ecosystem</strong> and have created some of the most popular React open source packages and repositories, like <a href="https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate">react-boilerplate</a>, one of the biggest React starter kits with almost 20,000 stars on GitHub, and <a href="https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components">styled-components</a>, an effort to package some distilled best practices into a reusable styling library with 19,000 stars on GitHub.  <strong>Development teams at Bloomberg, Reddit, Atlassian, Coinbase, Patreon and hundreds of other companies rely on my work to power their React apps.</strong></p>
    <p>Now you can <strong>hire me to bring my expertise to your production codebase!</strong> Boost your teams day-to-day agility and get your product moving faster than ever before!</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>My audits take on a specific form:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You give me access to your codebase and I spend a day deeply investigating and auditing it</li>
        <li>I compile a report full of recommendations tailored to your codebase, team and business goals, designed to <strong>speed up day-to-day development for years to come by confining technical debt, implementing specialised tools</strong> and much more</li>
        <li>After your team has digested the report we do <strong>an hour long call</strong> about the recommendations and to answer any questions they may have</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These code audits have a fixed price of 2,000€ (+ 20% VAT), with a 50% downpayment upfront.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or want to schedule an audit please reach out!</p>
