    <h1>Remote Codebase Audits by a React expert</h1>
    <p>I'm available for hire for remote codebase audits of React applications. I do a day-long deep dive into your codebase and compile <strong>a report full of recommendations for small changes with a big impact on your development teams agility</strong>, tailored to the team and your business goals.</p>
    <blockquote>
        "Max helped us to clarify the main obstacles in our codebase, gave us a lot of useful advice about testing &amp; development and already saved us a lot of time. I can't recommend him highly enough!"

    <h2>Why you should hire me</h2>
    <p>I'm an expert and community leader in the React ecosystem and have created some of the most popular React open source packages and repositories. <strong>Development teams at Bloomberg, Reddit, Atlassian, Coinbase, Patreon and thousands of other companies rely on my work to power their React apps.</strong></p>
    <p>Through the creation of <a href="https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate">react-boilerplate</a>, one of the biggest React starter kits with almost 20,000 stars on GitHub, <strong>I got to view and critically asses hundreds of production React applications and distill their best practices.</strong> The invention of <a href="https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components">styled-components</a> was an effort to package some of these best practices into a reusable library, to huge success and critical acclaim with 19,000 stars on GitHub.</p>
    <p>Now you can <strong>hire me to speed up your development team with a lesson tailored to your production codebase.</strong> My audit will boost your teams day-to-day agility to get you moving faster than ever before.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>My audits take on a specific form:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You give me access to your codebase and I spend a day deeply investigating and auditing it</li>
        <li>I compile a report full of recommendations tailored to your codebase, team and business goals, most of which involve quick modifications to reduce technical debt and implementing specialised tooling</li>
        <li>After your team has digested the report we do an hour long call about the recommendations and to answer any questions they may have</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These code audits have a fixed price of 2,000€ (+ 20% VAT), with a 50% downpayment upfront.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or want to schedule an audit please reach out!</p>
